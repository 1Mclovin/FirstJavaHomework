        //double is almost the same just end with 'd' this is way safer than float because it allows for 16 more digits

//Type Casting

        //ex below for widening casting

        //Assignment operators
        //Comparison operators
        //Logical operators
        //Bitwise operators

 // strings
     //strings are used for storing texts

        System.out.println(lengthofStringy + lengthofStringy.length());

      // \n would make a new line wherever placed

 // MATH

         int randomNum = (int)(Math.random()* 51); // this generates a random number from 0 to 50
